In my opinion, the worst part of this sort of witch-hunt is that making such a baseless accusation has zero consequences for the accuser. The anonymity of the internet arms people with the power to wreck lives in an instant, feeding into an unhealthy lynch-mob mentality. The Boston Bombing witch-hunt is an example of cognitive surplus gone wrong. Clay Shirky, in his book <em>Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age</em>, praises the advent of Web 2.0 as a \u201crevolution\u2026 centered on the shock of the inclusion of amateurs as producers, where we no longer need to ask for help or permission from professionals to say things in public.\u201d User generated content is cool; everybody loves cat-pictures and youtube videos, but to negate the drawbacks of cognitive surplus is foolish. When reputations are on the line, and people will do anything for on-line recognition, a little professional fact-checking could go a long way. For Sunil\u2019s family, and others affected by witch-hunts, this is no \u201cTechno-Utopia\u201d.</p>\n<p>Citations:</p>\n<p>\u00b7 Shirky, Clay.

Though Sunil\u2019s name was ultimately cleared on live television, in only a few hours his family had already received hundreds of death threats, anti-islamic messages, and hateful phone calls. Despite apologies from journalists and bloggers who had aggregated Sunil\u2019s false identification, the emotional toll on Sunil\u2019s family was devastating.</p>\n<p>Business Insider\u2019s article tells the story of the witch-hunt, but really doesn\u2019t capture its implications. In my opinion, the worst part of this sort of witch-hunt is that making such a baseless accusation has zero consequences for the accuser. The anonymity of the internet arms people with the power to wreck lives in an instant, feeding into an unhealthy lynch-mob mentality. The Boston Bombing witch-hunt is an example of cognitive surplus gone wrong. Clay Shirky, in his book <em>Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age</em>, praises the advent of Web 2.0 as a \u201crevolution\u2026 centered on the shock of the inclusion of amateurs as producers, where we no longer need to ask for help or permission from professionals to say things in public.\u201d User generated content is cool; everybody loves cat-pictures and youtube videos, but to negate the drawbacks of cognitive surplus is foolish. When reputations are on the line, and people will do anything for on-line recognition, a little professional fact-checking could go a long way. For Sunil\u2019s family, and others affected by witch-hunts, this is no \u201cTechno-Utopia\u201d.</p>\n<p>Citations:</p>\n<p>\u00b7 Shirky, Clay.
